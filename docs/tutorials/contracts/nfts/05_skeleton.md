## Introduction

Talks about how this is a 0 to hero set of tutorials and how this specific tutorial will go through just the minting process and how we need to modify the skeleton in order to get an NFT minted and showing up in the wallet.

:::info New to Rust?
If you are new to Rust and want to dive into smart contract development, our [Quick-start guide](/docs/develop/contracts/rust/intro) is a great place to start.

## Skeleton

Talk about the skeleton contract and the file structure. Show how all the functions are laid out and the code needs to be filled in. Explain that the return types have been removed so that the contract can compile. 

Go through the process of building the contract (yarn build) and how there will be a bunch of warnings that will be fixed as the tutorials go on.
