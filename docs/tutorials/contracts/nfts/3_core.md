## Introduction

Talk about how at this point, we’ve created a simple NFT contract with minting and enumeration. We will then expand to introduce the core standard which allows for transferring NFTs. If users want to follow along from before, that’s fine but if they want the previous completed code, they should checkout the 3.enumeration branch

## Modifications to the contract

We will modify the `core.rs` file as well as add more functions into the `internal.rs` file. 

```rust reference
https://github.com/near-examples/nft-tutorial/tree/4.core/nft-contract/src/lib.rs#L1-L3
```

We can then use the CLI to call the methods and show how to transfer NFTs to `benjiman.testnet` ;). We can then use the enumerable methods to show that the new owner is benjiman.testnet

## Conclusion

We talk about how we’ve added the ability for users to transfer NFTs and how if they want the finished code, they can checkout the 4.core branch. Briefly introduce the next tutorial which is aimed at allowing other accounts to transfer NFTs on your behalf. 

## Bonus track

I’m not sure what we can do here - maybe some sort of gifting tutorial which the theme of NFT christmas presents? Haha (we can have josh’s testnet account be the grinch who tries to steal NFTs).
