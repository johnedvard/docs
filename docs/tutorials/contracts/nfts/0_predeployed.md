In this tutorial you'll learn how to easily create your own non-fungible tokens without doing any software development by using a readily-available NFT smart contract.

## Overview

This article will show you how to use an existing [NFT smart contract](#using-the-nft-contract), and you'll learn [how to mint](#minting-your-nfts) non-fungible tokens from media files stored on a web server and view them in your Wallet.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial successfully, you'll need:

- [A NEAR account](/docs/develop/basics/create-account)
- [NEAR command-line interface](/docs/develop/contracts/rust/intro#installing-the-near-cli) (`near-cli`)

## Using the NFT contract

If you have all the tools in place, you're ready to start using the NFT smart contract to [mint your NFTs](#minting-your-nfts).

Log in to your newly created account with `near-cli` by running the following command in your terminal.

```bash
near login
```

To make this tutorial easier to copy/paste, we're going to set an environment variable for your account ID. In the command below, replace `YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME` with the account name you just logged in with including the `.testnet` (or `.near` for `mainnet`):

```bash
export NEARID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME
```

Test that the environment variable is set correctly by running:

```bash
echo $NEARID
```

### Minting your NFTs

NEAR has already deployed a contract to the account `nfts.examples.testnet` which allows users to freely mint tokens. This is the account we'll be interacting with to mint our NFTs. 

Now let's mint our first token! The following command will mint one copy of your NFT. 
Please remember to replace the `token_id` value with an unique string.

:::tip
You can also replace the `media` URL with a link to any image file hosted on your web server.

```bash
near call example-nft.testnet nft_mint '{"token_id": "my-token-unique-id", "receiver_id": "'$NEARID'", "token_metadata": { "title": "Some Art", "description": "My NFT media", "media": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Olympus_Mons_alt.jpg/1024px-Olympus_Mons_alt.jpg", "copies": 1}}' --accountId $NEARID --deposit 0.1
```

  "metadata": {

    "extra": null,
    "reference": null,
    "reference_hash": null
  },
  "approved_account_ids": {}
}
```

To view tokens owned by an account you can call the NFT contract with the following `near-cli` command:

```bash
near view example-nft.testnet nft_tokens_for_owner '{"account_id": "'$NEARID'"}'
```

***Congratulations! You just minted your first NFT token on the NEAR blockchain!*** ðŸŽ‰

## Final remarks

This basic example illustrates all the required steps to call an NFT smart contract on NEAR and start minting your own non-fungible tokens.

Now that you're familiar with the process, you can jump to [Contract Architecture](/docs/tutorials/contracts/nfts/skeleton) and learn more about the smart contract structure and how you can build your own NFT contract from the ground up.

***Happy minting!*** ðŸª™
