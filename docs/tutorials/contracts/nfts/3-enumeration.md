In this tutorial you'll learn how to ...

## Introduction

We introduce this as being an extension to the minting tutorial where we cover different enumeration methods that can be used to return contract state. We talk about how you can either extend the work you did in the previous tutorial or you can checkout the `2.minting` branch. 

## Modifications to the contract

We go through the enumeration.rs file and fill out the functions and explain what they do. 

```rust reference
https://github.com/near-examples/nft-tutorial/tree/3.enumeration/nft-contract/src/enumeration.rs#L6-L24
```

We can then use CLI to query for those methods and show how they work. 

```rust reference
https://github.com/near-examples/nft-tutorial/tree/3.enumeration/nft-contract/src/enumeration.rs#L26-L41
```

## Conclusion

We talk about how at this point, we have a basic NFT contract with minting and enumeration methods in place. We then talk about how if they want the finished code, they can checkout the `3.enumeration` branch. 

## Bonus track

Have some sort of random NFT displayer frontend
